# Statistical Shape Modeling (SSM)

This Matlab code was created by Dr. Jan Bruse and Dr. Benedetta Biffi in 2017. It consists of a Matlab GUI interface calling
two other free softwares responsible for the PCA and the shapes registration: Deformetrica 4.2 (http://www.deformetrica.org/) and VMTK 1.4 (http://www.vmtk.org/)
to allow a smooth experience of the user with statitiscal shape modelling. 

SSM is a tool to compute averaged shape and its variations within a coherent family of geometries (or training set). It is based on the assumption that each shape of the family is a deformed version of a reference shape. It uses Principal Component Analysis (PCA) on a set of landmark points to describe the shape of an object.

This code has been updated by Emilie Sauvage (July 2019) in order                        
use solely the Prinicpal Component Analysis part using the latest Deformatrica version (v4.2)

Note for beginners: before you start please read the code and folder structure below:

This is **an overview of the folders structure** created by the SSM code:


![Folders architecture](https://github.com/ClinicalCardiovascEngGroup/SSM/blob/master/GPA_IterationFolders.png)

To **run** the code please folow these instructions:

* *Step 0*: Make sure that Test_Folder ONLY contains the STLs files and nothing else (no folder named "RegistrationAtlasConstruction" for example)\
* *Step 1*: Go to "SSM" directory which contains the "main" file (ShapeAnalysis_OnlyPCA_2019.m)\
* *Step 2*: Type in a terminal "shapenv" --> this will call VMTK and Deformetrica environments\
* *Step 3*: Then type the command: "matlab ShapeAnalysis_OnlyPCA_2019.m"\
* *Step 4*: Click in the middle of the text editor where the main code appears (green play botton on top panel). A window "MATLAB Editor" appears asking to change the current folder path. Click on "Change Folder" button and go to your Test_Folder\


For those of you who which to work on the code directly, here is a small overview of the code architecture:

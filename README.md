# Statistical Shape Modeling (SSM)

This Matlab code was created by Dr. Jan Bruse and Dr. Benedetta Biffi in 2017. It consists of a Matlab GUI interface calling
two other free softwares responsible for the PCA and the shapes registration: Deformetrica 4.2 (http://www.deformetrica.org/) and VMTK 1.4 (http://www.vmtk.org/)
to allow a smooth experience of the user with statitiscal shape modelling. 

SSM is a tool to compute averaged shape and its variations within a coherent family of geometries (or training set). It is based on the assumption that each shape of the family is a deformed version of a reference shape. It used Principal Component Analysis (PCA) on a set of landmark points to describe the shape of an object.

This code has been updated by Emilie Sauvage (July 2019) in order                        
use solely the Prinicpal Component Analysis part using the latest Deformatrica version (v4.2)

# Statistical Shape Modeling (SSM)

This Matlab code was created by Dr. Jan Bruse and Dr. Benedetta Biffi in 2017. It consists of a Matlab GUI interface calling
two other free softwares responsible for the PCA and the shapes registration: Deformetrica 4.2 (http://www.deformetrica.org/) and VMTK 1.4 (http://www.vmtk.org/)
to allow a smooth experience of the user with statitiscal shape modelling. 

SSM is a tool to compute averaged shape and its variations within a coherent family of geometries (or training set). It is based on the assumption that each shape of the family is a deformed version of a reference shape. It uses Principal Component Analysis (PCA) on a set of landmark points to describe the shape of an object.

This code has been updated by Emilie Sauvage (July 2019) in order                        
use solely the Prinicpal Component Analysis part using the latest Deformatrica version (v4.2)

### Dependencies of the code:

* MATLAB (not older than R2018b)
* Deformetrica 4.2
* VMTK 1.4

### How to run - Manual

Please clone the Git repository on your machine:
`git clone https://github.com/ClinicalCardiovascEngGroup/SSM.git`

Alternatively, if you are NOT planning to modify the code and use the sources as such, you can also download the content of the repository on your machine.

What you will get:
* a main file `ShapeAnalysis.m` 
* a folder containing all MATLAB functions called by the main
* a PDF document written by Dr. Bruse and Dr. Biffi giving more details on the present Matlab code
* a README.md 

Before you start, make sure all dependencies are correctly installed and tested.
For Linux users, you are advised to create the following environment in your .bashrc:

`function condaenv {
  __conda_setup="$('/opt/anaconda3/bin/conda' 'shell.bash' 'hook' 2> /dev/null)"
  if [ $? -eq 0 ]; then
      eval "$__conda_setup"
  else
      if [ -f "/opt/anaconda3/etc/profile.d/conda.sh" ]; then
          . "/opt/anaconda3/etc/profile.d/conda.sh"
      else
          export PATH="/opt/anaconda3/bin:$PATH"
      fi
  fi
  unset __conda_setup

  export PATH=/opt/anaconda3/bin:$PATH
}`

`function deformenv {
  condaenv
  conda activate deformetrica
}`

`function vmtkenv
{
  source /opt/vmtk/Install/vmtk_env.sh
}`


`function shapenv {
  vmtkenv
  deformenv
}`

#### Note for new comers:
before you start running the code please read the code and folder structure below:

This is **an overview structure of the folders** created by the SSM code during a run:


![Folders architecture](https://github.com/ClinicalCardiovascEngGroup/SSM/blob/master/GPA_IterationFolders.png)

To **run** the code please folow these instructions:

* *Step 0*: Make sure that Test_Folder ONLY contains the STLs files and nothing else (no folder named "RegistrationAtlasConstruction" for example)
* *Step 1*: Go to "SSM" directory which contains the "main" file (ShapeAnalysis_OnlyPCA_2019.m)
* *Step 2*: Type in a terminal "shapenv" --> this will call VMTK and Deformetrica environments
* *Step 3*: Then type the command: "matlab ShapeAnalysis_OnlyPCA_2019.m"
* *Step 4*: Click in the middle of the text editor where the main code appears (green play botton on top panel). A window "MATLAB Editor" appears asking to change the current folder path. Click on "Change Folder" button and go to your Test_Folder
* *Step 5*: A first menu with 2 choices appears. Click on the top button "Registration and Atlas construction"

![Menu 1](https://github.com/ClinicalCardiovascEngGroup/SSM/blob/master/Screenshot_Menu1.png)

If you choose "Registration and Atlas construction":

* *Step 6*: A window appears asking to select the input mesh files for Registration. Go to Test_Folder ie. "/SSM/Test_Folder" and select (highlight) ALL STL files presents. You should also see a folder named :"RegistrationAtlasConstruction". Don't worry about this folder - it was created after step nr. 4
This 5th step will first create an Input folder (See the overview structure of the folders in the picture above  - GPA_IterationFolders.png).

To perform the GPA analysis on the registered geometries:
  
* *Step 7*: After iteration 0, you should be prompted with another menu (of 3 entries) asking you "What would you like to compute?". Click on "Registration - Generalized Procustes Analysis". During this step, two consecutive actions are taking place: a registration with VMTK then the computation of the average shape computation from the previously registered geometries.

![Menu 2](https://github.com/ClinicalCardiovascEngGroup/SSM/blob/master/Screenshot_Menu2.png)

This step will perform the next iteration (=iteration nr.1) and prompted you with a small "End session" window asking you: "Would you like to continue with another registration and atlas construction step?". Click on "Yes" to perform the next iteration.

![End Session 1](https://github.com/ClinicalCardiovascEngGroup/SSM/blob/master/Screenshot_EndSession1.png)

* *Step 8*: The same menu (of 3 entries) asking you "What would you like to compute?" will appear. Click one more time on "Registration - Generalized Procustes Analysis". An additional window with all parameters needed for the computation of the averaged model from Deformatrica will appear. Modify those parameters as you wish (default parameters are provided). Press on "OK" button. We are now at iteration nr. 2. In the folder "RegistrationAtlasConstruction", you should now see 3 sub-folders: Input, iteration_1, iteration_2
At the end of this step you should see a graph window displaying distance from previous template vs. number of iterations and another small "end session" window asking: "Would you like to continue with another registration and atlas construction step?". Click on "Yes" to perform the next iteration. 

* *Step 9*: After iteration 2, you should be prompted with another menu (of 3 entries) asking you "What would you like to compute?". Click on "Registration - Generalized Procustes Analysis". This step will perform the next iteration (=iteration nr.3) 
Continue the ietrations until you are statisfied with the distance from the previous template - the curve should reach a plateau after a few iteration - this plateau is a good moment to stop iterating.
